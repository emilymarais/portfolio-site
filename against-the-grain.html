        <p>For this project, I was challenged with designing a modern and sleek user interface for an online store. I decided that the store would deliver fresh and sustainable produce from local stores, saving users time on visiting multiple
          places to find good quality ingredients.</p>
        <p>The challenge was to design a clean interface while representing the brand’s identity as a sustainable organisation focused on changing the way things are usually done.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>In order to reconcile the sleek and clean look which was required with the bold personality I intended to imbue into my designs, I looked for inspiration in the graphic design of Extinction Rebellion and the Glasgow Alliance to End
          Homelessness, as well as the UI design of Future Noodles and Weezy.</p>
        <p>I was drawn to these designs due to their loud typefaces and ability to make their products attractive to young people. They were able to refresh topics which are normally presented in boring and unengaging ways.</p>

        <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
        <p>I decided to rely on typography to strike the balance between bold and sleek. Pairing ‘Red Rose’ with ‘Inter’ allowed me to communicate AGAINST THE GRAIN’s messaging without compromising on the clean and modern look which was required.
        </p>
        <p>At this point I also decided on the name ‘AGAINST THE GRAIN’ and developed a logo based on this concept. The name and logo convey the brand’s central focus on food products, while displaying a willingness to break norms and create new
          systems. The colour scheme was decided concurrently with the logo.</p>

      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p>This process began with paper sketches and rapid ideation. This allowed me to figure out the app’s basic architecture, to which I could begin to add touches of personality, determined by the brand identity.</p>
      <p>The challenge was to keep the UI uncluttered while conveying the app’s strong message. To achieve this, I chose to include clean imagery with neutral backgrounds, and to limit my use of colour, allowing the typography to shine. Colour was
        used only when needed to direct users’ attention, creating an intuitive experience.</p>

      <h2>Final Touches</h2>
      <p>With a well defined brand identity, I developed each screen from low-fidelity to high-fidelity through a process of iterative design and user testing. I encountered problems through conducting remote prototype tests, but I was still able
        to extract enough information to make changes to my app which improved the user experience.</p>
      <p>My final product consisted of 5 mobile screens and 1 desktop landing page which includes an animation below the fold.</p>
